The following is a list of files which you can use to change how your MAD ATV behaves.<br>

<li><b>/sdcard/madmac</b> - Sets the eth0 MAC addy. This happens automatically on your first boot on a95xf1. Can only contain a valid MAC address (some that look valid are not accepted by ifconfig)
<li><b>/sdcard/madmac2</b> - Sets the wifi MAC addy. Can only contain a valid MAC address (some that look valid are not accepted by ifconfig)
<li><b>/sdcard/pingreboot</b> - activates the pingreboot script, which helps if your wifi drops randomly. see [pingreboot.sh](https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-ATV/blob/master/pingreboot.sh)
<li><b>/sdcard/madversion</b> - (or something like that) contains the version of mad rom being used
<li><b>/sdcard/disableautopogoupdate</b> - disables pogo autoupdate
