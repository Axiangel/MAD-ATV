The following is a list of files which you can use to change how your MAD ATV behaves.

/sdcard/madmac - Sets the eth0 MAC addy. This happens automatically on your first boot on a95xf1. Can only contain a valid MAC address (some that look valid are not accepted by ifconfig)
/sdcard/madmac2 - Sets the wifi MAC addy. Can only contain a valid MAC address (some that look valid are not accepted by ifconfig)
/sdcard/pingreboot - activates the pingreboot script, which helps if your wifi drops randomly. see pingreboot.sh script in github
/sdcard/madversion - (or something like that) contains the version of mad rom being used
/sdcard/disableautopogoupdate - disables pogo autoupdate
