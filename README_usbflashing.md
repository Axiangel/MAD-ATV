How to flash a ROM using a USB-a to USB-a cable.
<br> Avoid the $1 cables because you need a data cable, not just a charging cable. People often have problems with longer cables. I got a $5 cable from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0E3954/) and it has been working perfectly for me.

<br> Run USB Burning tool
<br> click File and then import image.
<br> select your rom and then click start (leave the other options alone)
<br> Plug the USB-A to USB-A cable in to the computer but not the box yet
<br> Then press in the reset button while plugging the usb cable into your computer and your android box.
<br> It will only work on 1 of your boxes USB ports, so if nothing happens try the other one. If that doesnt help try other ports on your computer, or maybe even another computer, or another cable
<br> When the box is seen in the burn tool it will start flashing. Connect the power cable.
